The exit status (or error level) approximates the exit codes defined by PKWARE and takes on the following values, except under VMS:

              0      normal; no errors or warnings detected.

              2      unexpected end of zip file.

              3      a  generic error in the zipfile format was detected.  Processing may have completed successfully anyway; some broken zipfiles created by other
                     archivers have simple work-arounds.

              4      zip was unable to allocate memory for one or more buffers during program initialization.

              5      a severe error in the zipfile format was detected.  Processing probably failed immediately.

              6      entry too large to be processed (such as input files larger than 2 GB when not using Zip64 or trying to read an existing archive that  is  too
                     large) or entry too large to be split with zipsplit

              7      invalid comment format

              8      zip -T failed or out of memory

              9      the user aborted zip prematurely with control-C (or similar)

              10     zip encountered an error while using a temp file

              11     read or seek error

              12     zip has nothing to do

              13     missing or empty zip file

              14     error writing to a file

              15     zip was unable to create a file to write to

              16     bad command line parameters

              18     zip could not open a specified file to read

              19     zip was compiled with options not supported on this system
